## Check it before you hand it over

A canvas is a file, so you can run a checker over it. `@genui/cli` validates exactly this
kind of TSX. Use the `check` import map path and command printed in the skill entrypoint, not
the standalone `build` map; if no type map is installed, omit `-i` and verify harness calls in the live panel.

Check only after the first usable card or Canvas exists. Run one bounded check for that exact
source and rerun only after editing the source or correcting the command/import map. Do not loop on
unchanged input, optional polish, or known mapped-import diagnostics; those results stay internal
and must not become progress or self-review text in the user-visible reply.

```
BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR="$TMPDIR/bun-cache" bunx --yes genui@https://pkg.pr.new/MindLab-Research/macaron-genui-demo/@genui/cli@main check <file> -i <type import map from the skill entrypoint>
```

**`bunx` needs the package NAME in front of the URL** — `genui@https://…`. Bun reads the whole
argument as `<name>@<spec>`, so a bare URL gives it an empty name and it stops at
`unrecognised dependency format` before fetching anything. Any name works; it is a label, not a
lookup.

If Bun is unavailable, use pnpx with the same type map:

```
pnpx --config.blockExoticSubdeps=false https://pkg.pr.new/MindLab-Research/macaron-genui-demo/@genui/cli@main check <file> -i <type import map from the skill entrypoint>
```

The pnpx command takes the bare URL. The pnpm flag is **not** optional — the CLI pulls `@genui/unocss` by URL
as well, and pnpm refuses URL-resolved SUBdependencies by default, so without it you get
`ERR_PNPM_EXOTIC_SUBDEP` naming a package you never asked for. Do **not** add
`--config.cacheDir` beside it: pnpm then loses the package's own bin and dies with
`spawn cli ENOENT`, which reads like the package is broken and is not. It needs no cache redirect
anyway — its store is the one of the three your sandbox lets you write.

**Bun does need the cache redirect** in a sandbox where `~/.bun/install/cache` is not writable.
`$TMPDIR` is writable, so point its install cache there.

`check` includes TypeScript diagnostics; `lint` is the faster syntax-only pass. The current CLI
resolves mapped `$dsh/*` imports as `any`: a valid `usePersistedState<T>` can produce TS2347 and
derived `any` diagnostics, while a nonexistent mapped export can be missed. Compare those calls
against the installed declarations and the capability reference; do not change correct code just
to make these false diagnostics disappear. Inspect every other diagnostic and fix real source errors.
That `any` can also hide a real error in a local member chain: if a persisted key selects an entry
from a typed record, compare the full render expression with the declared entry shape (for example,
`Record<Goal, Item[]>` yields an array, so use `tracks[goal].filter(...)`, not
`tracks[goal].items.filter(...)`). Check the initial render path before calling the card working.
Treat a non-zero exit, command-not-found, timeout, missing import map, or missing report as
**unchecked**; if a checker limitation remains, say the static check did not pass and verify
the live card when available. Rerun after source edits or a corrected invocation, not unchanged input; only a fresh zero for that
exact file supports saying it passed. After real source errors are fixed and applicable checks finish,
hand over the card instead of spending another round on optional polish. Do not prepend a
platform-specific `timeout` command when the host does not provide it; invoke the checker directly
or use the host's available process deadline.

Either way, the way to see your work actually run is to write the canvas and look at the panel.

### Mechanical source audit before handoff

Run a finite source pass over the complete card before sending or writing it:

- Search `useState(` and every control binding (`value=`, `checked=`, `selected=`,
  `aria-pressed=`, `aria-checked=`). Inspect every user-editable expression; it must come from
  `usePersistedState`, while `useState` is reserved for transient UI, request status, abortable
  work, or visual feedback. A mode or standard that changes a formula, threshold, classification,
  or explanatory text is persisted input too.
- For every send/apply/submit handler with an editable draft, verify that it copies the exact current draft snapshot into a separate committed value and then disables/no-ops the draft, or
  clearly labels a later action as update/resend. The UI must not say sent/applied while rendering
  a different editable draft.
- For a generated batch, clear an uncommitted pick before a refresh starts and make the submit handler verify that the pick belongs to the successful batch for the active filters. A disabled-looking button alone is not a guard; test a filter change or regeneration with a previous pick still stored.
- Search action copy for “自动回复”, “选完即”, “submit”, “提交”, and “生成”, then compare each
  claim with the real handler. A separate Submit means option clicks only change draft state; a
  claim of automatic reply means the option handler itself sends and guards duplicate sends.
- For “next person”, “clear progress”, or “reset progress”, inspect the handler rather than the
  button label. It must functionally update the current persisted object; `setBoard(DEFAULT_BOARD)`,
  `setBoard(SEED)`, or `cloneFresh(...)` is valid only behind a separately labelled restore-default
  template action.
- For a reported or submitted canvas, inspect the serialized payload/key and confirm it includes
  every editable field, not only `done`, `total`, or another aggregate count. For numeric results,
  check each label against its formatter and source scale (`fmtWan` vs `fmtYuan`) and run one known
  sample through the displayed unit.
- For an expression explorer, test meaning as well as compilation: check a range step against
  multiple expected matches (for example, `5/10` minutes includes `:05`, `:15`, and `:25`), and
  reject malformed fields such as `*/` or `/5`; check rare calendar matches against a search
  horizon long enough to reach one. Do not call a valid sparse expression impossible because a
  short preview window found no match. If a preview says "next runs", advance its clock while the
  card is open and clean up its timer on unmount; an old `new Date()` result becomes past tense.

For an inline card, run the same final check over the complete assistant reply, not only the
extracted TSX or a cleaned-up transcript: there must be one opener that is exactly ````ui4a/tsx````
and one closer that is exactly ```` on its own line, with a blank line before the opener. A
three-backtick `tsx` block, an opener joined to prose, a scratch/example fence, or a second closing
fence is a protocol failure even when the source itself compiles. If the card owns a calculation,
conversion, or threshold, remove every computed answer and numeric summary from prose before and after the fence; the card must be the only place that reports it. Quote any glob, regex, or other
pattern containing `{}` when it appears as JSX text (`{"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"}`), then run the real
compile and paint checks again.

**Two mistakes it reports that do not blow up**, both found in real cards written here, and both
the kind you never notice because the thing still works:

- **Two utilities that set the same property.** `className="grid … flex"` does not merge and does
  not error — which of them wins is decided by the order the rules were generated in, not by the
  order you wrote them, so it can differ between a streaming frame and the settled card. The
  older form of this was a duplicate key in a style object (`{ display: "block", …, display:
  "flex" }`, last one wins, first silently dropped); the class form is harder to see because the
  two words sit inside one string. Read the whole class list before adding a layout word to it.
- **Writing a ref during render.** `statusRef.current = status` in the component body reads as a
  cheap way to keep a loop's view of state fresh, and React is explicit that it is not one; do it in
  an effect. A long-running AutoPlay is exactly where this bites, because the loop outlives the
  render that set it.

It is worth the round trip because it catches the mistakes that cost the most here — the ones
that otherwise reach the user as a blank card with nothing in the console. Each of these was
run through it and the message is quoted as it actually comes back:

- `<META[key].icon />` — JSX allows the member form `<a.b />` but not a subscript.
  "JSX element type '<the object>' does not have any construct or call signatures".
- `import { Pie } from "recharts"` beside `export default function Pie()` — "Import
  declaration conflicts with local declaration". Nothing fails at build time; at runtime the
  component recurses into itself until React throws #185.
- `<Fragment>` used without importing it — "Cannot find name 'Fragment'". A `ReferenceError`
  at render, so the card mounts and shows nothing.
- A glob or a regex quantifier written as JSX text — `<code>src/*.{ts,tsx}</code>` reports
  "Cannot find name 'ts'", which is precisely what it will throw when the reader opens it.

What it does **not** catch is worth knowing too, so you do not read a clean run as a working
card: a hook called at module scope, and a hardcoded `#fff` background, both pass. Those are
yours to get right.

Skip it for a small inline block you can read in one screen. Run it on anything long, and on
anything you are about to leave in the workspace as a canvas.

**Read the report, do not obey it blindly.** A mapped `$dsh/*` import can propagate `any` into
lambda parameters; annotating only to silence those secondary diagnostics adds no safety. An
`implicitly has an 'any' type` elsewhere may hide a real bug, so trace its source. Act on wrong
mechanisms too: conflicting declarations, duplicate keys, unknown names, and comma operators.
