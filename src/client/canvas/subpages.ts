/**
 * Rewrites a canvas's relative imports into blob URLs, before the source is compiled.
 *
 * `src/prompt.ts` tells the model that a canvas's sub-pages live in `<id>/` and are imported
 * with relative paths, and the model does exactly that. But a card is imported as a blob URL,
 * and `blob:` is not a hierarchical scheme — the browser rejects `./tarot/deck` with
 * "Invalid relative url or base scheme isn't hierarchical" before any import map is consulted,
 * so `setImportMap` cannot help. Measured: an import map keyed on the relative specifier fails
 * identically, because resolution against the importer's URL happens first.
 *
 * Replacing the specifier with the child's own blob URL removes the question: an absolute URL
 * has no base to resolve against. Children may import their siblings, which works for the same
 * reason once they too have been rewritten.
