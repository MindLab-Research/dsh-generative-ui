 * What it IS: the approval layer does not reach here. `approval.request()` needs an open turn and
 * an agent, and a card fires on a reader's keystroke long after its turn ended — so the per-command
 * fence is the sandbox policy alone. Under `workspace-write` a card can therefore delete inside the

 * ("observe, never change"; anything destructive belongs in a `sendMessage` the user agrees to),
 * which is guidance, not a fence.
