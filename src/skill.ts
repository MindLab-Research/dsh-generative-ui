/**
 * Runtime registration for the packaged skill entrypoint and its references.
 *
 * `dsh-base` mounts the `dsh-skill` tooling by default, so a runtime registration here
 * shows up in the model's `<available_skills>` catalog and its body is fetched only when the
 * model calls `skill({ name })`. The entrypoint then routes to packaged references, which are
 * read only when the card needs them. The resident prompt stays short for pure-prose turns.
 *
 * The catalog carries `name` and `description` **only** — not `whenToUse`, not the body — so the
 * description is the entire routing signal and has to name the trigger, not summarise the content.
