/**
 * How the canvas tab type reaches the host's right Sidebar.
 *
 * Two ways for this to be wrong and still look fine: registering the body under the definition's
 * `kind` instead of its `id` (the type is accepted, and no tab ever reaches the body), and
 * putting the sidebar services in the static `inject` (a host without them loses the whole
 * plugin rather than just the canvas panel).
